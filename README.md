# Project_portfolio_3

This project uses the Spotify Web API to perform a generalized global search for Artists, Albums, and Tracks. This project contains both a frontend and a backend in a microservice structure that keeps track of OAuth JSON web tokens. This project serves as a template for other projects inside of the Project Portfolio III course. DO NOT COPY.

# Prerequisites

Docker Engine >= latest (for Mac or other platform)
NodeJS >= v16.13.0
Yarn >= v1.22.19
npm >= v8.1.0
Brew >= v3.4.3 (if MacOS)
MySQL Server >= v8.0.28
Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge >= Latest 2 major versions

# Other Considerations

Ports 3000, and 3001 must be open on host OS. Make sure no other applications are running on those ports by running the following command:

sudo lsof -nP -i4TCP:3000 | grep LISTEN && sudo lsof -nP -i4TCP:3001 | grep LISTEN
If any results shows are displayed then you must close the application running on either of those ports.

# Getting Started

In order to setup the project we will need to setup our .env file. You can do this by making a copy of our .env.dist and naming it to .env using the following command.

cp .env.dist .env && vim .env
Place all of your environment variables inside the vim window, then save. After you have done that you will need to install all of your node_modules using the following command. Make sure you have yarn installed globally as well.

npm install -g yarn
yarn
After yarn has finished installing all of your node_modules you can now run the project. You will need to open two different bash sessions. One for the frontend app and one for the backend Express application.

To Run Nuxt.js (frontend)

cd nuxt
yarn dev
To Run Express (backend)

yarn watch
